#Wishlist is a shopper's dream! It’s a one-stop application that easily submits and saves future online purchases.

How does it work? 

1.Grab a site’s URL and submit it to Wishlist.

That’s it! After saving the product, Wishlist will create an entry in your (future) shopping cart using information directly from the URL’s web page. 

Save all your items at the click of a button, it’s not wishful thinking, it’s Wishlist. 



<sub><sup> While hundreds of more sites may be added soon, Wishlist currently only supports Amazon. </sup></sub>
